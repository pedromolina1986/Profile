                Heavy metal is a genre of rock music known for its loud, powerful sound, distorted guitars, and
                often dark or fantastical themes. Black Sabbath pioneered the genre in the late 1960s and early
                1970s with songs like "Paranoid" and "War Pigs," featuring doomy riffs and ominous lyrics. Iron
                Maiden brought a melodic and fast-paced style to metal with songs like "The Trooper" and
                "Hallowed Be Thy Name," emphasizing intricate guitar work and storytelling. Judas Priest, known
                for their twin-guitar attack and high-energy performances, helped define classic heavy metal
                with anthems like "Breaking the Law" and "Painkiller."
